# Night shift

Originally ordered by a client but then cancelled, this projects aim to create a simple, minimalistic shift booking
application for employees.

## Features

Current functionality:
* registration
* loging in
* profile overview

Future functionality:
* user data editing
* shift scheduling in waves - employees are assigned to ordered groups, and cannot join a shift until the previous group
  has done so
* management access and overview of employees
* calendar overview
* subscribable calendar
* reports
* domain e-mail verification (or maybe a provided token authentication) - so that non-employee internet users cannot
  create an account and use the app.

## About
